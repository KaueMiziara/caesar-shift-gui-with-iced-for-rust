The Caesar Cipher is one of the most famous encryption technique.<br>
It consists in, given a number that will be used as a "key" (also called "shift"), replacing each letter in a word for the letter *key* positions down the alphabet, i.e. with a shift of 1, "ABC" will turn into "BCD".<br>
The method was named after Gaius Julius Caesar, a roman general and emperor that used this cipher with a shift of 3 to send messages to his generals.
